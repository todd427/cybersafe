  "debrief": "Smart! This was a romance scam. Red flags: 1) Moving too fast emotionally, 2) Excessive flattery and claims of special connection, 3) Will soon ask for money or gift cards, 4) Creates dependency quickly. Real relationships develop slowly. Be suspicious of anyone online who professes strong feelings quickly or asks for money. Talk to a trusted adult if someone pressures you this way."
