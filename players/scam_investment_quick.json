  "debrief": "Excellent! This was an investment scam. Red flags: 1) Promises of easy/quick money, 2) Pressure to invest now, 3) Unsolicited approach with 'special system', 4) Asking for money upfront. Real investing requires research, has risks, and no one offers strangers guaranteed money. These scams either take your money directly or get you to recruit others. Always talk to parents before any money decisions."
