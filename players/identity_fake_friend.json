  "debrief": "Smart thinking! This was an identity thief posing as a classmate. Red flags: 1) Vague about specific shared experiences, 2) Asking for birthday and schedule (security question answers and patterns), 3) 'New phone' excuse to explain not having your number, 4) Using common names and scenarios. Always verify through another channel - ask them something only the real person would know, or contact them through a known account. Never give personal info to unverified contacts."
