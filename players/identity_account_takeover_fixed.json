  "debrief": "Perfect! This was an account takeover scam. Red flags: 1) Instagram never asks for your password, 2) Creating panic with deletion threat, 3) Random message instead of in-app notification, 4) Asking for all account security info. Real security alerts appear inside the app, not via random messages. Social media companies never ask for passwords. Always check inside the actual app for security notifications. If concerned, go directly to the app or website - never through links in messages."
