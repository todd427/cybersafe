  "debrief": "You did the right thing by getting help! This is serious cyberbullying and potentially illegal. Red flags: 1) Extortion (demanding something under threat), 2) Using embarrassment as weapon, 3) Time pressure to force bad decisions. Critical points: 1) NEVER give in to threats - it won't stop, 2) Tell parent/school counselor/principal IMMEDIATELY, 3) This is potentially criminal depending on the photo, 4) The bully can face serious consequences. Document everything. Schools and sometimes police take this seriously. You're not alone - adults can and will help stop this."
