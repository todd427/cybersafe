  "debrief": "Smart choice! This was malware disguised as a free game. Red flags: 1) 'Free' version of paid software is piracy and illegal, 2) Telling you to ignore antivirus warnings is a HUGE red flag, 3) File size too small for a real game, 4) Sketchy website instead of official store. Malware can steal passwords, install ransomware, or use your computer for illegal activity. The 'free' game could cost you way more in damages. Only download from official sources: Steam, App Store, official websites. If you can't afford something, ask parents or wait for sales."
