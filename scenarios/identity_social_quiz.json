  "debrief": "Excellent! You spotted the trap! This 'fun quiz' is actually collecting common security question answers. Red flags: 1) Mother's maiden name - classic security question, 2) Street you grew up on - another common security question, 3) First pet - also used for password recovery, 4) Birth month adds to profile. Scammers use this info to break into accounts or steal identity. These quizzes seem fun but are data mining. Don't share answers to security questions publicly."
