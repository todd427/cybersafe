  "debrief": "Great job! This was a job scam. Red flags: 1) Hired without application or interview, 2) Asking for Social Security Number too early, 3) Requiring payment for 'training materials', 4) Too good to be true pay for simple work. Real employers never ask for money. They pay you for training. Always research companies and discuss job opportunities with parents first."
