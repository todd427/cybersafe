  "debrief": "You handled that well! This was cyberbullying and extortion. Red flags: 1) Threatening to embarrass you, 2) Demanding things (money, changed behavior), 3) Using fear to control you. Important: Giving bullies what they want never stops them - it makes it worse. The right steps: 1) Don't engage or give in, 2) Screenshot the threats as evidence, 3) Block them, 4) Tell a trusted adult immediately (parent, counselor, principal). This is serious and adults can help. Most importantly - everyone has embarrassing old posts. Real friends won't care."
