  "initial_message": "Just thought you should know everyone was talking about you in the group chat after we removed you. They all think you're super annoying and fake. Like literally NO ONE wants you around. Maya said you try too hard and Jake was laughing about your outfit yesterday. Just giving you a heads up so you stop embarrassing yourself. 🙄",

  "debrief": "Good job staying strong! This was social cyberbullying through exclusion and rumors. Red flags: 1) Claiming to speak for others, 2) Using specific names to make it seem real, 3) Trying to hurt your self-esteem, 4) 'Just giving you a heads up' - fake kindness that's actually mean. Reality check: Bullies often lie about what others said. Real friends don't remove you and mock you - they talk to you directly about issues. This behavior says more about the bully than you. Talk to a trusted adult about social bullying. Consider whether this group is worth your energy."
