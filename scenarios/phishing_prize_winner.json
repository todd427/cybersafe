  "debrief": "Well done! This was a phishing scam using fake prizes. Red flags: 1) You didn't enter any contest, 2) URL uses '0' instead of 'o' in Amazon, 3) Creating false urgency with expiration, 4) Real companies notify winners differently. If it seems too good to be true, it usually is. Always verify contest wins through official channels."
