  "debrief": "Excellent! This was a fake security warning (scareware). Red flags: 1) Real antivirus doesn't use pop-ups with phone numbers, 2) Creating panic with capitals and urgent warnings, 3) Asking you to download unknown software or call random number, 4) Real security software is already on your computer - it doesn't advertise through web pop-ups. Right action: Close the browser (don't click anything in the pop-up), run your ACTUAL antivirus if worried, tell a parent. These fake warnings either install malware or lead to phone scams. Real security is quiet and professional, not scary and loud."
