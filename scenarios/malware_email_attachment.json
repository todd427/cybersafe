  "debrief": "Great catch! This email contained malware. Red flags: 1) .exe file extension - this is an executable program, NOT a document, 2) Schools send schedules as PDF or in student portals, never as .exe files, 3) Email domain looks similar but isn't the real school domain, 4) 'Run as Administrator' gives malware full access. An .exe file could install ransomware, keyloggers, or worse. Only open attachments from verified senders, and NEVER .exe files from email. Schedules should be PDFs or viewed in your school portal. When in doubt, don't open it - verify through official school channels."
